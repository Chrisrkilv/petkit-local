"""Declarative models for the event/media/pet store (SQLite, `{data_dir}/petkit.db`).

The schema is deliberately denormalized and JSON-loose (`content_json`,
`state_json`): the device payload shape is still being reverse-engineered, so
only the fields we have confirmed get a column and the untouched payload is
kept beside them — the same philosophy `devices/state_parsers.py` applies to
state_report parsing. Recomputing a derived column from the raw JSON later is
then a backfill (`events/migrations.py::backfill_event_rows`), not a data loss.

What the rows MEAN on the wire — `event_uid` versus `related_event` as a
SESSION key, the numeric `dev_event_report` `event_type` codes, the
`moduleType` -> `category` mapping — is documented once, in
`events/normalize.py`'s module docstring. It is the authoritative reference and
is not repeated here.

These models describe a table set that is already deployed, so column names,
types, nullability, defaults and index names are fixed: `create_all` only ever
creates a table that does not exist yet, and a live database is upgraded in
place by `events/store.py::EventStore._migrate`.
